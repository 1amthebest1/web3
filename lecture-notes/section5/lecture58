- Mappings give out default value, when nothing is stored there.
- So it does not mean that false occupied memory or something.

	-> Is not like a vector or array.

	-> Has no preallocated memory.

	-> Returns default values for unset keys.

----

- EVM's memory [storage (data of smart contract that gets stored on the blockchain)], is stored 2^256 keys, each of which map to a 32 byte (8*32 bits)

- The hash-function finds address of keys for storage data.

==
	Let’s say you have: mapping(bool => uint) myMap;
	and this variable is declared at storage slot 1
	
	Now, in EVM terms:
			
			- Slot 1 doesn’t hold any mapping data.

			- Slot 1 is just the “identifier” (or seed slot) for this mapping.	

==
	EVM pads the unused bits in memory to 0.
