- when assert fails, it calls panic op code, which eats up all the gas

- assert is basically used to ensure the correct data types are used [checks internal errors], to stop bugs such as roll-over issues.

- assert() is meant to test for invariants â€” conditions that should always be true.
- If an assert() fails, it indicates a bug in the code (not just bad user input).
