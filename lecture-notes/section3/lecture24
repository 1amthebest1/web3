-> Ephemeral means temporary

-> functions with (data-type memory name), are given temporary memory till execution, and then are gone, i guess something like heap?

-> In Solidity, there are 3 main memory locations, [ Storage, Memory, Stack ]

---
Storage
---
	-> Stored Permanenty on the chain.
	-> State variables (declared outside any function).
	-> Persists between function calls, and transactions.
	-> Costs Gas to read, and write.

---
Memory
---

	-> Temporarily allocated in memory during execution.
	-> Function arguments, or local variables declared with memory.
	-> Exists only when function is executing, then is destroyed.
	-> like Heap (But Solidity doesn't have a true heap), Instead, the EVM has a “scratchpad” area called memory that resets to empty every time a function executes.

---
Stack
---

	-> Fast-access register-like space.
	-> Used for small local variables like uint, address.
	-> Also Destroyed after function execution.
	-> Max 1024 slots per EVM.

-> A view function in Solidity is a function that reads data from the blockchain, but does not modify it.

-> String is a dynamically sized array of bytes, thus it cannot be used for something like keccak256.

-> keccask hash is used in Ethereum to create a unique fingerprint of data, ID's, POW, and other.

---
bytes
--- 

	-> Strings are technically Bytes, but you see byte representation in getter function.
	-> also support functions like .length().
	-> Strings however uses UTF8.
	-> The weird german charachters use 2 bytes in length.
	-> That's why strings are not recommended.
