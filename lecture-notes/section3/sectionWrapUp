WRAP UP
---

Value types

	- Bool
	- Int / Uint
	- Address //wallet address etc
	- String
-
All variables are initialized by default
-
	- There is no null, undefined.

	- There are initialized as follows

		U(int)=0
		Bool=false
		String=""

Public variables generate a getter with a name of the variable, so you can't create a function
with the same name as the name of the variabel.

-

Uint8 from 0 to 255.

int8 from -128, 127.

2**8, is 2 power 8.

uint is an alias for uint256, which is 256 bit long

---

Automatic wrap around for unchecked values

---

There are no floats, and doubles, instead it uses a scale for example scale 100 theoretical representation of 3.23 as 323

	-> Its to avoid dicrepancy in calculation by nodes

---

Floats use 18 decimal places via scale 18

Address: Every interaction in ethereum is address based, used to send ether.

  -> has property called balance, that gives the balance in WEI.

---

String and Bytes are both special arrays, string is equal to bytes, but doesn't have length or index access

-> Bytes for arbitrary length data, string for UTF-8 data.

---

Bytes store non-human readable data, string store human readable data [By-Convention]
