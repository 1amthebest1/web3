-> Byte-Code: Byte-Code is like machine code, for virtual machines.
	
	- In hexadecimal.
	- Cross-Platform [Same Byte Code can run in Windows, Linux etc].

-> EVM: Byte Code, that ethereum Virtual Machine Runs.

-> Mining: 

	- Miner takes transactions waiting to be confirmed, the previous block's hash, metadata, and a random number called nonce (a 32-bit number miners can change).
	- combine them, and put it into a SHA256 function.
	- The result is a hash, a long hexadecimal number.
	- If the number's leading zeros (means the number is smaller, or equal to the difficulty target of the block) matches the zeros of the difficulty target then the block is found.
	- In Bitcoin, the difficulty target is adjusted every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks).
	- The goal: make sure one block is mined every ~10 minutes, regardless of how much total computing power (hash rate) the network has. 
	- If miners are finding blocks too quickly, â†’ difficulty increases (target gets smaller â†’ more zeros required).
	- If blocks are found too slowly, â†’ difficulty decreases (target gets larger â†’ fewer zeros).

-> You can choose any nonce you want, but you can't predict the SHA256 outcome.

-> When a miner finds a valid nonce and thus a valid block, they get a block reward + transaction fees. 
	
	- Current reward (as of 2025):

	- Block reward: ðŸŸ¢ 3.125 BTC

	- Plus: All transaction fees from that block

-> The reward halves every 210,000 blocks (~every 4 years) in whatâ€™s called the Bitcoin halving.

-> In Proof of Stake (PoS)

-> Thereâ€™s no guessing or hash race.

-> Validators are randomly selected to propose a block (Depending on how much You stake, you are picked that way).

	- They just build the block (collect transactions, reference the previous block, sign it).

	- Other validators then verify it.

-> Transaction Pool is where transactions are waiting before being added to a block.

-> Its Turing Complete: Meaning it can solve, any computation given enough time.

-> A full node is a computer running Ethereum software (like Geth, Nethermind, or Besu) that:

	- Stores the entire blockchain, and
	- Verifies every transaction and block itself.

	- In simple terms, itâ€™s like having your own copy of Ethereum, and checking every single rule personally â€” instead of trusting anyone else.

-> Every Full node runs all smart contract code, and does all calculations, and stores the entire chain's data.


	--- KEY TAKEAWAYS ---

	- Smart Contracts are Running on Block Chain.

	- They are turing complete

	- Deployment is done with a transaction.
