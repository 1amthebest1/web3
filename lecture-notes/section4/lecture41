   RPC [Remote Procedural Call]


====
Send crypto
Your wallet builds a signed transaction and sends it to a node via RPC → the node broadcasts it → miners/validators confirm it.
====

Miners select transactions before they find the block,
and everyone validates them after the block is found.

====

Nodes are pieces of software running the etherium protocol, this protocol allows
nodes to sync the data, and the underlying block-chain data, chained together with the
hash of the previous block.

KEY TAKE-AWAYS
====

- You need a Blockchain node to interact with the Blockchain.
- Blockchain is the single source of truth.
- There are infrastructure provides like infura, that abstract running Blockchains for you
