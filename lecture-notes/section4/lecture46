-> By default smart contracts cannot receive anything.

-> To recieve ether transfer the contract should have either 'receive' or 'payable' fallback function.

-> A receive function is a function that can recieve ether.

-> When ETH is sent via .transfer(), or .send(), the EVM limits the gas sent to the contract to 2300 gas, for security safety

-> If there is no data, if there is just a value transfer without any kind of data, it hits a recieve function, when there is data, it needs a fallback function.

-> If there is value being sent, without data, it will call the fallback function in the absence of a receive function.
