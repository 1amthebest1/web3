Transaction Details on Etherscan
--------
	
	- Transaction Hash: (unique hash for every transaction, with which you can identify transaction with).
	- Status: Success.
	- Block: "some number" (every time a block is created, it gets added to the chain).
	- Timestamp: Time of transaction (when the new block was created and the transaction went through).
	- From: From Address.
	- To: To Address.
	- Value: The amount
	- Transaction Fee: The transaction fee.
	- Nonce: The number of transactions send on block chain, nonce 1, means 2 transactions on the block-chain.
-> Transaction Fee = Gas Units Used * Price per Gas Unit

-> The Transaction fee gets deducted from the account sending the tokens, and its native to the network, for Etherium its eth, also referred to a "Gas Token".

✅ Ethereum test networks (testnets) are indeed separate blockchains, but they are designed to replicate the Ethereum mainnet’s functionality as closely as possible.

Here’s the key idea:

🧩 Relationship to Mainnet

Testnets run the same Ethereum protocol and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) as the mainnet.

However, they have different chain IDs, different native tokens, and separate states — meaning balances, contracts, and transactions on a testnet do not exist on mainnet.

They are completely isolated networks — but designed to simulate mainnet behavior for development and testing.

--------

💡 A single blockchain (like Ethereum) supports all tokens.
Each token does not have its own blockchain — instead, every token is implemented as a smart contract on top of the same Ethereum blockchain.

--------

🪙 2. Tokens live inside Ethereum as smart contracts

A token (like USDT, DAI, SHIB, LINK, etc.) is just a smart contract deployed on Ethereum.

These contracts follow standard interfaces like:

ERC-20 → for fungible tokens (currencies, governance tokens)

ERC-721 → for NFTs

ERC-1155 → for mixed-type assets (both fungible & non-fungible)

Each token contract defines:

How many tokens exist

Who owns what

How transfers work

Example:
When you “send” 10 USDT to someone, the USDT smart contract updates its internal balance records — no new blockchain or coin is created.

--------

If you want your token to behave like other tokens on Ethereum,
you must implement these specific functions and behaviors, such as USDT, shib etc.

--------

DeFi = Decentralized Finance
It’s the financial system built on blockchains (like Ethereum) that runs without banks, brokers, or centralized intermediaries.

--------

If you send a transaction with a really low gas fees, and you next transaction has high gas fees, it wouldn't get mined until the previous one finishes.

--------

Each block has:

A maximum gas capacity (e.g., in Ethereum ~30 million gas).

So if total pending transactions need 60 million gas, only half can fit in the next block.

The rest wait in the mempool for later blocks — or may be ignored forever if the fee is too low.
