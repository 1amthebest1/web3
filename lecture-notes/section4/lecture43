Gas-Price Auction: The higher the gas price, the more likely it gets mined.

If you send the transaction with the same nonce (counter that indicates which transaction number the transaction is), it replaces the existing transaction.

To Speed up the transaction you send the transaction with the nonce you want to replace, with a higher gas fee.

To Cancel the transaction you send the transaction with the same nonce, but you [send no data + to]=from.

The old transaction stays the mem pool as well, but you send a send a new transaction that gets mined faster, invalidating the nonce of the previous transaction

Sending a transaction with a high gas amount, after a pending transaction with lower gas amount will not go through, since the previous has not been yet completed.

This is because you cannot jump a number in nonce.

if you send the transaction to yourself with the SAME NONCE, you will cancel it; you send 0 ETH to yourself.

---

Cancel transactions with higher nonce first, because if you cancel earlier transactions its going to mine the transactions with higher nonce automatically.
