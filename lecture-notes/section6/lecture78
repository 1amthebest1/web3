- web3 JS allows you to talk to the block chain

- web3 JS is a javascript library that allows you to do RPC calls via, something like a nodeJS app, or your browser.

- It does not get mined or something.

- When you compile a solidity contract, the compiler produces two main outputs, bytecode for the EVM to run, and an ABI

- ABI is basically JSON data, that shows information about the functions, and variables.

- if we use metamask, for web3, we are communicating with the node that metamask uses for RPC calls [default {infura}].

- The keyword async before a function makes the function return a promise

- promises, have a resolve, and a reject, which you can use via chaining with a .then()

=====

The get balance function, returns a promise, like fetch()

web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0])
  .then(value => console.log(value))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
