- EVM has loggin functionality, via events, however they are only accessible outside the blockchain, even though they are stored in the chain.

- Used for return values from transactions.

- Used as a cheap data storage.

- Functions / transactions return a "transaction hash", not return values, which are observable only in remix.

- when something like require fails, the EVM returns an encoded error message, not the event.

- storing data on block-chain as storage variables is expensive, so you can store it via an event, or have a DB on your website, with transaction hash etc.

- Events cannot be accessed within a smart contract.

- you need 640,000 gas per KB of data storage.

- you are limited by gas?, which doesn't even allow to store a MB of data on a contract.

- Storing via events on the blockchain costs, 8192 gas per KB.
