- There is function overloading in solidity.

- using objects of class, you call the function via the dot operator i.e object.function();

- 🧩 virtual

  Declared in the parent contract.

  It means: “This function can be replaced (overridden) by a child contract.”

  If a function is not marked virtual, you cannot legally redefine it in a derived contract.


- override

 Declared in the derived contract.

 It means: “This function replaces a virtual function inherited from a parent.”

 Solidity requires override explicitly to prevent unintentional overrides (which were common in older Solidity versions).

----

you can also deploy smart contracts via the new keyword.

such as Animal animal = new Dog(); deploys a contract of Dog, and stores its address in animal

- Animal doesn’t need to have an address member manually — Solidity handles that internally, its like a pointer to a contract.

____

multiple inheritance syntax

- contract child is GrandFather, Father {}
----

You can access the parent contract using the "super" keyword.

----

You only deploy the child contract, everything gets put in one byte code.

----

"virtual" defines parent functions that are allowed to be overridden by child contracts.

----

"override" defines function that are overriding a function of base contract.

----

A function can obviously be both override and virtual.

Imports

	- import "filename"

	- import * as symbolName from "filename" //when you have mulitple contracts

	- import {onecontract as renamed, secondcontract} from "file"
