- modifiers injects code, i.e 

	//some check, or code of modifier, such as require()
	//-;  //rest of the code of the function that is using the modifier


- syntax

	modifier onlyOwner {
		
		require(msg.sender==owner);
		_;
		
	}

- The compiler takes the content of the function and puts it at _; of the modifier, and then put everything back into the function itself.

- To reuse functionality of a smart contract, that can be used by another smart contract, we have "Inheritance".

- You say that this smart contract has a base (parent) smart contract, its syntax is 

	
	childSmartContract is ParentSmartContract{
		
	}

- You create the parent in another file, and then import it from the path, to shorten the file size. The compiler handles the inclusion of the parent Contract by itself.
