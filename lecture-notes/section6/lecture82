- The return variables are not written on the Blockchain, only for inter-smart contract [inside smart contracts]

	{
	 Return variables (i.e. values returned by functions) are not stored on the blockchain. 
	 They only exist temporarily in memory during a transaction or call. Once execution finishes, the EVM discards them.
	}

- That's why we have Events.


- Events are recorded on the blockchain as transaction logs (permanent, verifiable), 
  but they are not stored in contract storage and cannot be accessed by smart contracts themselves â€” only by off-chain tools.


- If transactions are rolled back, the event does not get sent.
