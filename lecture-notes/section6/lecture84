- Key phrase goes through algorithm to create address, the addresses that meet the EVM's cryptographic standard are same, 
  which allows a single address to interact with all chains that follow Ethereum Protocol, 
  the one such as Solana, has its own chain and algorithm thus a different wallet address is created to interact with Solana.

- Logging also costs gas

- Apart from the topic generated by the prototype, you have 3 more arguments to help filter for past events.

- filters work with only indexed keyword [verify and look into this].

- The block-chain will not send you an event back, if it doesn't fit the filtered value.

- You cannot do "less than", or "greater than" operators on filter, only "equals to"
