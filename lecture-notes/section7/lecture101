- EIP721: Standard Interface for Non-Fungible Tokens, also known as deeds.

- Big misconception: Metadata for NFT's is immutable.

- NFT meta-data, is file description that tells what the NFT actually is.

======================	

	Name: Title of the NFT. eg {Crypto-Punk}
	Description: Human-Readable explanation of the NFT. lore, story, traits, whatever the creator wants.
	Image/Media url: Usually stored off chain.
	
- Attributes / Traits

- A set of key–value pairs describing the NFT’s features, often used in collectible projects:

	[
		 {"trait_type": "Background", "value": "Blue"},
		 {"trait_type": "Eyes", "value": "Laser"},
		 {"trait_type": "Rarity", "value": "Legendary"}
	]

- Animation / Video links.

======================

- Each NFT is an entry (token ID + owner) inside a deployed ERC-721 contract, and its properties/attributes are defined in a metadata file, not in the contract.

- Many NFTs are not as immutable as people assume.

- The ownership is immutable, but the meaning of what you own can be altered by the project owner unless the system was designed correctly.

======================

- Token ID
	
	- Token ID is defined as uint256 inside the ERC721, which shall NOT change for the life of contract.
	
	- Its globally unique, and fully qualified Identifier for the asset.
	
	- It would be obviously convenient for the Dev to start the TokenID with zero, and increment it. BUT the callers should not assume that a number has a pattern etc, and should be black box.
