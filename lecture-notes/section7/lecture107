- migrations are basically deployment, but called migrations

- you start naming the files as 01-spacebear.js, so truffle knows in which order to compile. I am not sure this behaviour is correct and real though.

- truffle goes through the migration files, imports the files and call the default function.

- syntax: module.exports=functionName, OR module.exports=function(){}.

- there's a function that has a deployer as argument, which basically deploys smart contracts.


- function(deployer){
	deployer.deploy(SpaceBear);
}

- truffle also comes with an internal blockchain!!!, just like remix.

- deployer, Object injected by Truffle to handle deployments

- Truffle compiles your Solidity files and puts the ABI + bytecode into that JSON file. Artifacts.require() reads that JSON and returns a contract abstraction that can be deployed.

- you then do "truffle develop" which starts a blockchain, and it gives you a shell, which is connected to the blockchain.

- then you type "migrate", which compiles your smart-contracts, and then deploys it.

- so basically truffle is something that uses a simulated blockchain like ganache, truffle compiles the contract creates JSON details about the contract etc, and deploys it to the simulated blockchain called ganache.
