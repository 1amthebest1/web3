- global node packages get installed in /home/node/global/ where they sit as binaries and can be called from anywhere.

- with truffle you can create something called truffle-contract in the truffle console, which i think might be using web3js under the hood, i am not sure.

- In short you can use JS in truffle console, to interact with a deployed smart contract.

===

- In unit tests, the contract() function is a magic function that tests your smart contract, it doesn't interact with the existing smart contract, but it re-deploys it.

- In unit tests, you can use different API's and all that such as chai, asserts etc.

- If you have react in the same folder, it may use the .env file for its build, which may get pushed into the frontend

===

THE NEXT STEP AS A BLOCK-CHAIN DEV IS TO WRITE UNIT TESTS, TRYING TO BREAK SMART CONTRACTS LOCALLY, ALSO LEARN TRUFFLE DEBUG.

CONCLUSION: This is the thing to learn, which is going to be fun inshallah
