-> AMM [Automated Market Maker].

-> Allows traders to buy, and sell tokens after calculating its price, of liquidity and number of tokens.

-> So basically its demand and supply, more coins, and less money backing it up means, the coins will be cheaper

-> amount of coins x money backing it up = constant
 
   if money is more for less number of coins, the coins become expensive to maintain the constant.

-> How much tokens to give => Constant / money given by buyer = tokens there should be. 
   tokens to give = So number of tokens before buying - tokens there should be.
