- Fungible means interchangeable, like ether and fiat, money and gold.

- In a nutshell, when dealing with non-fungibles (like your house) you care about which ones you have, 
while in fungible assets (like your bank account statement) what matters is how much you have.

- pause() function pauses operations, such as token transfer, or minting new tokens


- Construct Transaction [nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to(contract address), value, data, chainId]
 -> RLP encode (unsigned) -> kessac_hash(RLP encoded (unsigned))
 -> sign (kessac_hash) -> Construct Transaction [nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to(contract address), value, data, chainId]
 -> RLP encode(signed) -> RPC call. 

- In Solidity, address(0) means “the zero address” — it’s a special address value with all bits set to zero.

 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

- pure functions don't read from the state.
