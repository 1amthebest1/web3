-> Each block has its gas limit.

	- ≈ 30 million gas per block

-> So miner does POS, finds new blocks, selects transactions with highest GAS fees, calculates them, broadcasts the results, the result gets validated, then pushed. 
   The targeted time for [calculating, verifying them and pushing] is 12 seconds. 
   New block will not get mined, until the transactions selected by the winner are completed. 
   Complex transactions maybe reverted, as they may exceed block gas limit.

-> When a function is payable and modifies state, it does not return data on-chain (it’s a transaction, not a call), and EVM discards the data of the return.

-> Gas: Max gas limit set by Remix.

-> Transaction Cost: Total Gas Used [Real Cost] {Includes storage costs, Includes DeploymentOverhead}

-> Execution Cost: Only code execution (pure EVM opcodes).
